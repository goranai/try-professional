# Changelog

Each version of `try-professional`. `skill-customs` is listed only when it changes.

## 0.1.1 (not published yet)

Fixes for what someone is likely to hit in their first ten minutes. No new features.

### Changed

- **A stopped command tells you what to do.** Its message says what happened, gives the `trypro decide` lines ready to run, and then the exact `/company continue <run-id>` line. It also says the count is the server's estimate, and that its work is saved.
- **A missing `GITHUB_TOKEN` is said up front.** `trypro init`, `trypro doctor`, and designing a company through Claude Code now explain how to set it before anything is spent. At a terminal, `trypro init` asks whether to go on with no skills.
- **Thin skill coverage links somewhere.** When under half of the role needs have a skill, the review screen links to a form for asking for skills for your industry.
- **`trypro doctor` works before a company exists, and on a broken one.** It no longer calls a Claude Code setup "not ready" because the experimental API runner isn't set up.

### Added

- **`trypro doctor --report`** prints a diagnostic to paste into a bug report: versions, system, and check results, with no keys, paths, or names.
- **Issue forms** for bugs, features, skills for an industry, and runtime support. Blank issues now point to Discussions, and security problems to private reporting.
- **"Your first pull request"** in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, this changelog, a [release checklist](docs/releasing.md), and a [v0.2 plan](docs/roadmap-v0.2.md).

### Fixed

- A `GITHUB_TOKEN` in `.env` wasn't seen when designing a company through Claude Code, so that company got no skills.

## 0.1.0 (2026-11-08)

The first public preview, for Claude Code: a company designed from one prompt, a role per subagent with its own server, memory, and skills, reviews and budgets enforced by code, and an audit log. `skill-customs` 0.1.0 was published alongside it.
